# STLs for a 6th Gen iPad Console

**Note: STLs have _not_ been oriented for optimal printing!**

The assembly is designed to fit two 300x300 plates. I printed the first ones on PETG but that caused the models to warp a bit, so maybe PLA would be better. Or maybe just some better temperature management to let everything cool down controlledly.

## BOM

For assembly, you need

- Glue, to glue the two front and two back panels together
- 4x M3 4mm deep heat-set inserts, and
- 4x M3x12 button head screws to assemble things
- _Optional:_ 2x 6x2mm round magnets and a 2mm Bahco L-shaped hex key

## Print

My print took about 750g of filament and over 11h of print-time at

- 25% Adaptive Cubic infill,
- 5 top shell layers
- 3 bottom shell layers
- 3 wall loops
- ~100mm/s print speeds and 5k mm/s2 acceleration
